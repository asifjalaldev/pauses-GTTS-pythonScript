# pauses-GTTS-pythonScript
This python script is written using pydub and moviepy libraries for adding functionality to pause the speech where question is asked in gtts API output.
when user input text contains question, the output audio file will take pauses of 3 second after each question.
as GTTS(google text to speech) API does not allow pauses exept period and comma. so adding extra pause is very difficult. here is my solution to that problem.
